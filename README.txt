This is a library for creating basic GUI elements in CMD.
This library is build using the curses module.
This library is made to simplify the creating process for some BASIC GUI.
Even though I hope to add as much as possible, it is impossible for me to create a function for every possible scenario, so my goal is to make the functions as versitile as possible
If you need anything super specific I highly sudgest checking the curses module.
